# Heretic2 rebased over Yamagi Quake II Remaster

Customized Quake2 engine with Heretic2 code parts.

Heretic 2 SDK code based on [Ht2Toolkit](https://www.quaddicted.com/files/idgames2/planetquake/hereticii/files/Ht2Toolkit_v1.06.exe)

Updated code based on [Heretic 2 Reconstruction Project](https://github.com/jmarshall23/Heretic2/tree/Engine-DLL)

Tested with [Heretic 2 Loki](https://archive.org/details/heretic-2-linux) release.

### cleanup code
```shell
sed -i 's/[[:blank:]]*$//' */*.{c,h}
```

Comments:

It's on really initial steps, it could be complied ;-), it runs mostly without
crashes. That's all what is good.

Drawbacks:
* huge amount of possibly dead code
* no menu implementations
* no books implementations
* code is little bit mess
* only gl1 has full support render
* soft,gl3,vk render has incorrect angles
* need to rewrite RF_TRANS_ADD to use quake2 logic

To check:
 * [ ] code use diffent angles values to quake2
 * [ ] broken jumps
 * [ ] third person code is different to quake 2
 * [ ] effects protocol is different to quake 2
 * [ ] progress bars has custom implementation
 * [ ] color type/paticles,
 * [ ] ANGLE_1 usage in client code,
 * [ ] different move code and noclip
 * [x] Incorrect 16 bit frame flag unset,
 * [ ] MAX_MODELS/MAX_SOUND define hardcode,
 * [ ] no action on button press.

Minimal file set from Loki release:

```

Code checked with:
```
map ssdocks
```

Goals:
* Implement minimal set required for single player,
* Multiplayer game or same protocol is not in priority,
* Raven code should be placed only in src/game or separate repository,
* All other code should be GPL or public domain,
* Minimal set of hacks over quake 2 engine.

# Yamagi Quake II Remaster

This is an experimental fork of Yamagi Quake II with ongoing work to add
support for Quake II Enhanced aka Q2 Remaster(ed). This enhanced version
has a lot non trivial changes, adding support isn't easy and takes time.
Feel free to try this code but you mileage may vary.

Have a look at the yquake2 repository for the "normal" Yamagi Quake II:
<https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2>

Alpha windows 64 bit [binaries](https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2remaster/releases).
Saves format is unstabled and could change between alpha releases.

State:

* GL1/GLES3/GL3/GL4/VK:
  * base1: no known issues,
  * base2: no known issues,
  * q64/outpost: broken level change,
  * mguhub: sometimes broken logic for surface fall in next maps.
* SOFT:
  * base1: broken wall light and wall glitch,
  * base2: broken wall light and wall glitch,
  * q64/outpost: broken level change, scale textures unsupported,
  * mguhub: broken wall light, sometimes broken logic for surface fall
     in next maps.

Monsters:

* incorrect dead animation for Arachnid,
* broken fire effect for Guardian.

# Yamagi Quake II

Yamagi Quake II is an enhanced client for id Software's Quake
II with focus on offline and coop gameplay. Both the gameplay and the graphics
are unchanged, but many bugs in the last official release were fixed and some
nice to have features like widescreen support and a modern OpenGL 3.2 renderer
were added. Unlike most other Quake II source ports Yamagi Quake II is fully 64-bit
clean. It works perfectly on modern processors and operating systems. Yamagi
Quake II runs on nearly all common platforms; including FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD,
OpenBSD, Windows and macOS (experimental).

This code is built upon Icculus Quake II, which itself is based on Quake II
3.21. Yamagi Quake II is released under the terms of the GPL version 2. See the
LICENSE file for further information.
