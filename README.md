# Yamagi Quake II Remaster

This is an experimental fork of Yamagi Quake II with ongoing work to add
support for Quake II Enhanced aka Q2 Remaster(ed). This enhanced version
has a lot non trivial changes, adding support isn't easy and takes time.
Feel free to try this code but you mileage may vary.

Have a look at the yquake2 repository for the "normal" Yamagi Quake II:

# Yamagi Quake II


Yamagi Quake II is an enhanced client for id Software's Quake
II with focus on offline and coop gameplay. Both the gameplay and the graphics
are unchanged, but many bugs in the last official release were fixed and some
nice to have features like widescreen support and a modern OpenGL 3.2 renderer
were added. Unlike most other Quake II source ports Yamagi Quake II is fully 64-bit
clean. It works perfectly on modern processors and operating systems. Yamagi
Quake II runs on nearly all common platforms; including FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD,
OpenBSD, Windows and macOS (experimental).

This code is built upon Icculus Quake II, which itself is based on Quake II
3.21. Yamagi Quake II is released under the terms of the GPL version 2. See the
LICENSE file for further information.
