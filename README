===============================================================================

This is the Yamagi Quake II Client, an enhanced Version of id Software's
legendary Quake II. Main focus is single player, the gameplay is
unchanged but many bugs were fixed. This code should run under any POSIX
compliant operating system, just type "make" oder "gmake" to compile.

This code is based upon Icculus Quake II, which itself is based upon id
Software's original code drop. Additional code and patches by many
contributers were used. It's released under the terms of the GPL version
2. You can read the whole licence under http://www.gnu.org/

===============================================================================

1. Installation
==============
Note: If you're using Debian Linux or a derived Distribution like
Ubuntu, you probably want to use the packages that are linked in the
Download section at http://www.yamagi.org/quake2. They'll even assist
you in installing the game data.

1.1 Retail version:
-------------------
If you own Quake II, first get the official point release to Quake II
3.20: http://www.quake.de/index.php?action=fileinfo&q=q2&element=21 Use
this and only this file! Unofficial "linux pointreleases" or something
like that will not work and crash your game!

Create a new directory "quake2/" and extract the just file you just
downloaded into it. Even if the file extension is ".exe" it's just a
normal zip file. Now delete the following files and directories:
- 3.20_Changes.txt 
- index.html 
- quake2.exe 
- ref_gl.dll 
- ref_soft.dll 
- baseq2/gamex86.dll 
- baseq2/maps.lst 
- ctf/ctf2.ico 
- ctf/gamex86.dll 
- ctf/readme.txt 
- ctf/server.cfg 
- DOCS/ 
- xatrix/gamex86.dll 
- rogue/gamex86.dll

Now put the Quake II CD-ROM into your cd drive and copy the file
"pak0.pak" and the directory "video/" to the baseq2-directory of your
installation.

1.2 Demo version:
-----------------
If you haven't got Quake II, try the demo version. Get it here: 
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pc/msdos/games/idgames/idstuff/quake2/q2-314-demo-x86.exe

Create a new quake2/ directory with a baseq2/ sub-directory and put the
pak0.pak and the players/ sub-directory you can find within the unzipped
files (in Install/Data/baseq2/) in your baseq2-directory. No patching
is needed for the demo, in fact it would break it.

1.3 Dependencies:
-----------------
 - X11 Windows System with development headers
 - OpenGL system headers (Mesa3D, nVidia, fglrx, etc.)
 - libvorbis with development headers
 - libogg with development headers
 - ZLib
 - SDL with development headers and sdl-config(1)

1.4 Compiling:
--------------
After you have set up the game data (from the full version or the
demo), you have to compile the Yamagi Quake II client. Just extract the
source, change into the new created directory and type "make" (Linux) or
"gmake" (FreeBSD). After the compilation finished copy the following
files out of release/ to your installation directory preserving the
directory structure:
- q2ded 
- quake2 
- ref_gl.so 
- baseq2/game.so 
- ctf/game.so (not for the demo version)

You should now be ready to start your brand new Quake II. Have fun.

===============================================================================

2. OGG/Vorbis playback
======================
Since most modern CD-ROM and DVD drives don't have an analog audio
output and most sound codecs don't have the appropriate input header,
it's no longer possible to play Quake II with the original Audio-CD for
background music. Therefore OGG/Vorbis playback has been added to Yamagi
Quake II. It can play the original soundtrack, like if the CD is in the
drive or customized playlists.

2.1 Setup for the original soundtrack:
--------------------------------------
Put your Quake II CD-ROM in your drive, start your favorite CD extractor
and rip the audiotracks into OGG/Vorbis files. These files must be named
after their track number. Remember! Since the first track on the CD ist
"data", the first audio track is number 2! If everything is done
correct, you should have: 02.ogg, 03.ogg, ..., 11.ogg. Alternatively you
can use a script provided by caedes, which can be found in the folder
"tools". It needs cdparanoia an oggenc, it should work with the main
game and both addons.
Put these files under baseq2/music, start Quake II, enter the "Options"
menu and set "OGG music" to enabled. "CD music" will be automaticly
disabled. Quake II will now play the OGG/Vorbis files instead of the
Audio-CD.

2.2 Setup for other music and playlists:
----------------------------------------
You can put normal OGG/Vorbis files into baseq2/music or your_mod/music.
If shuffle is enabled, Quake II will shuffle through all files.
Otherwise it will loop through the track associated with the map.
Therefore playlists can be used. Just put the filenames into
music/playlists (a plain text file) and start the game. For manuell
control there are some CVar. Remember, these are only available, if "OGG
music" is enabled!

2.3 Manual control:
-------------------
- ogg_play {file | #n | ? | >n | <n}
 Play a file, the argument can be one of:
  * A file in "music", without the path and ".ogg" extension.
  * A # followed by a number, to play the Nth file in the playlist.
  * A ? which indicates to play a random file.
  * A > which indicates to advance N positions (defaults to 1).
  * A < which indicates to go back N positions (defaults to 1). 

- ogg_stop
 Stop playing the current file

- ogg_pause
 Pause the current file

- ogg_resume
 Resume the current file.

- ogg_seek {n | >n | <n}
 Go to a determinated position of the file in seconds, the argument can be
 one of the following:
  * n, which indicates to go to the nth position.
  * >n, which indicates to advance n positions.
  * <n, which indicates to go back n positions.
 You can use "ogg_seek >0" and "ogg_seek <0" to get the current position
 without changing it.

- ogg_status
 Display status (if playing a file, if paused, if stopped, etc.).

2.4 Console variables:
----------------------
- ogg_enable {0 | 1}
 Enable the Ogg Vorbis subsystem when in "1". Defaults to "0".

- ogg_playlist {name}
 Use "name" as a list of files instead of listing the contents of "music". 
 Note that the files must be in "music" and follow ogg_play's syntax for 
 files. Defaults to "playlist".

- ogg_sequence {next | prev | random | loop | none}
 When a file ends, start playing another one, depending on the value:
  * next: play the next file.
  * prev: play the previous file.
  * random: play a random file.
  * loop: play the same file again.
  * none: stop playing.
 Defaults to "next".

- ogg_volume
 Volume of the music from 0 to 2. Defaults to "0.7".

3. Widescreen
=============
Yamagi Quake II has full support for widescreen setups. Just select your
favorite resolution and start a game. Now you'll need to adjust the fiel
of view. Open the console with pressing "^" or "~" and set the fov cvar.
Default is 90, I suggest 100 for 16:10 screens and 105 for 16:9.

===============================================================================

4. Bugreports
=============
Something is not working as expected? An elevator is broken? An enemy
doesn't move? Or the whole game is just crashing? Just drop me an e-mail
to quake2@yamagi.org. Please include a problem description and - if
possible - a screenshot of the problematic situation and the name of the
problematic map. But first, read this little FAQ:

My sound is not working!
 - Most reported sound problems exist between keyboard and chair. Please
   make sure, the the correct SDL sound backend is installed and
   configured! Does the sound work in other SDL games? Does your setup
   support at least five virtual channels? In most cases it's better to
   not use sound servers like Pulseaudio but the plain sound system
   like OSS or ALSA with libalsa instead. Also see below the FAQ "Okay,
   my sound is messed up. What should I do?"

My OpenGL is not working!
 - Make sure, that OpenGL is working in other games. Use "glxinfo" and
   "glxgears" to make sure, that hardware rendering ist available.
   Otherwise, fix your setup. If reporting OpenGL bugs please include a
   copy of your xorg.conf (if available) and the Xorg.0.log.

===============================================================================

5. FAQ
======

How do I open the console?
 - Press "^" or "~", depending on your keyboard layout. 

How do I get the frame counter?
 - Set cl_drawfps to 1

How do I make a benchmark?
 - Set timedemo to 1 and play a demo.

How do I play demos?
 - "demomap name.dm2". Remember, the extension .dm2 is important!

How do I record a demo?
 - "record name" and "stop" to stop.

When playing in window mode my is locked onto the window. Can I change
that, e.g. that Quake II is behaving like a normal window?
 - Open the console with pressing ~ or ^. If you want Quake II to never 
   grab the mouse set "windowed_mouse_always" to 0, if Quake II should 
   never release the mouse set 1, for releasing the mouse when open the 
   console set to 2. The default is 2.

Hey, why is Quake II so slow?
 - Because of some bugs in Mesa3Ds implementation of GL_EXT_point_
   parameters Quake II doesn't use this OpenGL command, resulting
   in the loss of about 50FPS on a GeForce 7950GT. If you've got a
   better OpenGL implementation (a bug fixed version of Mesa3D, the
   nVidia driver or ATi fglrx) you can enable this command by
   uncommenting line line 57 of the Makefile. 

How do I set a custom resolution?
 - Set gl_customwidth and gl_customheight to the desired values. Change
   gl_mode to -1 or enter the "Video" menu and select "Custom" as
   video mode.

Okay, my sound is messed up. What should I do?
 - Remove all sound servers like pulseaudio oder phonon and make sure
   you sound setup supports at least 5 virtual channels. If you're using
   ALSA and that doesn't help create an file named ~/.asoundrc with this 
   content:

   pcm.!default { 
   type hw 
   card 0 
   } 

   ctl.!default { 
   type hw 
   card 0 
   }

Hey, my screensaver crashes Quake II or I expire strange crashes after a
fixed amount of time!
 - This is a known bug in some linux distributions. See this Ubuntu
   bugreport: 
   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screensaver/+bug/32457
   As a work around use the startscript in tools/quake-start.sh It
   deactivates the screensaver before starting Quake II and reenables it
   after exiting the game.
