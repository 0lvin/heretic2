This is the Yamagi Quake II Client, an enhanced Version of id Software's
legendary Quake II. Main focus is single player, the gameplay is
unchanged but many bugs were fixed. This code should run under any POSIX
compliant operating system, just type "make" oder "gmake" to compile.
Remeber, you'll need a working SDL installation and the OpenGL system
headers!

This code is based upon Icculus Quake II, which is based upon id
Software's original code drop. It's released under the terms of the GPL
version 2. You can read the licence under
