Instructions for VC++:

You'll need the Glide2X SDK.
You WONT need MFC. I hate MFC. Win32 is bad enough.

You'll need to add ALL the .cpp files to the project.
Add these to the list of libraries to link with:
  glide2x.lib
  comctl32.lib

You'll need to add resource.rc to the project.

And you'll need to add an additional include directory -
files in the /engine subdirectory need to include files
in the base directory. So if the tree was in D:\sinview
you'd need to have D:\sinview as an additional include
directory.

As always, I tried to keep it readable, and cut-and-pasteable.

Thanks to Mark D. at Ritual for help on the file formats.
