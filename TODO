Windows Port TODO
-----------------

- Check WITH_SYSTEMWIDE
- Ensure that all new headers have header guards.
- Replace atoi(), atol() and atof() in Windows code.
- Replace rand() with randk() in Windows code.
- Implement Sys_AppActivate() as soon as cl_hwnd is
  ported to Yamagi Quake II.
- Check of "rb" is the correct mode to open files in
  filesystem.c
- Does the alt-tab handling on windows really work?
  And do we need it?
- Is AppActivate() really necessary?
- Does anisotropic filtering work under Windows?
- Remove leftovers from the softrenderer.

The big plan:
 1. Get the dedicated server builded (03/06/12)
 2. Get the game builded (04/06/12)
 3. Be able to connect to a windows dedicated server (04/06/12)
 4. Get the client builded (04/06/12)
 5. Get the refresher builded (04/06/12)
 6. Be able to start the client and watch the demo loop (04/06/12)
 7. Bugsfix until the game can be played through
 8. Finish remaining TODOs
 9. Release CFT

Thinks that would be nice to have (after the CFT):
- Remove IPX
- Add IPv6
