Windows Port TODO
-----------------

- Check WITH_SYSTEMWIDE
- Does anisotropic filtering work under Windows?
- Remove leftovers from the softrenderer.

The big plan:
 1. Get the dedicated server builded (03/06/12)
 2. Get the game builded (04/06/12)
 3. Be able to connect to a windows dedicated server (04/06/12)
 4. Get the client builded (04/06/12)
 5. Get the refresher builded (04/06/12)
 6. Be able to start the client and watch the demo loop (04/06/12)
 7. Bugsfix until the game can be played through
 8. Finish remaining TODOs
 9. Release CFT

Thinks that would be nice to have (after the CFT):
- Remove IPX
- Add IPv6
