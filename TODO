Windows Port TODO
-----------------

- Check WITH_SYSTEMWIDE
- Is Sys_GetClipboardData() really usefull?
- Call Sys_AppActivate() in cl_main.c? (otherwise remove it)
- Is Sys_GetGameAPI() correct?
- Add platform defines for Windows in common/ and game/
- Check if we really need all the stuff in winquake.h
- Due to a bug in MinGW the _controlfp() option defines _PC_24
  and _MCW_PC are not available. While Quake II may work without
  them, we should try to find a workaround. See:
  http://mingw-users.1079350.n2.nabble.com/MinGW-missing-
  controlfp-and-related-defines-Looks-like-not-td7278570.html
- Currently the Makefiles needs a special "mkdir.exe" which 
  supports the -p option. We need a better aproach so that 
  the Windows buildin "mkdir" can be used.
- The Makefile needs some love. '' cannot be used as quotation
  marks under Windows and shouled be changed to "".
- Ensure that all new headers have header guards.
